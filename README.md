AES encryption framework with AI-driven enhancements, ensuring proactive security, high performance,  and low latency.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has a significant impact on the transportation industry. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) were created to make daily activities easier by hauling goods, distributing packages, and easing traffic. The AVs had a wide range of uses and comprised land vehicles, aerial vehicles, and maritime vehicles. The Cyber Security (CS) enabled data transfer autonomous driving was set up by them to facilitate the solution of this challenge. A network acts as the mediator, downloading data of the transmitter to the autonomous car. For additional safety, the CS-based method Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is involved to decrypt the data, which is transferable to cypher text. The encryption content could be deciphered by the secret key which is given by the transmitter to the peculiar AV. Customized particle swarm efficiency would be used to modify a conventional neural network. The researchers proposed product's final stage should be to decrypt the document using dual encryption technology. After the dual cryptography, steganography techniques are used to improve the retention safety of the proposed solution. Their proposed approach was implemented in the Java work area using Internet simulation.

The future of the Artificial Intelligence-based Security Solution for Data Encryption using AES Algorithm is filled with promising enhancements and innovations. One key enhancement is the integration of more advanced machine learning algorithms to predict and prevent potential security breaches. By leveraging AI, the system can learn from past data and continuously improve its threat detection capabilities, making it more robust against evolving cyber threats.
Another significant enhancement involves expanding the encryption algorithms beyond AES. Incorporating algorithms like RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and post-quantum cryptography can offer a multi-layered security approach, providing additional protection and making the system resilient to different types of cryptographic attacks. This diversity in encryption methods can significantly enhance the overall security framework.
Enhancing user authentication methods is also a critical future improvement. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometric verification can significantly reduce unauthorized access risks. Combining these methods with AI-driven anomaly detection can provide a more secure and user-friendly experience, ensuring that only legitimate users can access sensitive data.
The system can also be enhanced by integrating with blockchain technology. Blockchain's decentralized nature and its inherent security features can be used to securely store and manage encryption keys, ensuring that they are tamper-proof and resilient against various attacks. This integration can further enhance the trust and reliability of the encryption solution.
Moreover, the future enhancements should include real-time monitoring and alert systems. By using AI and machine learning, the system can continuously monitor for suspicious activities and provide real-time alerts to administrators. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the response time to potential threats, minimizing the risk of data breaches.
Lastly, improving the user interface and making the system more user-friendly will be an important enhancement. Providing intuitive dashboards, clear visualizations of security metrics, and easy-to-navigate settings can make the system more accessible to non-technical users. This can ensure that a wider range of organizations can implement and benefit from the advanced security features provided by this AI-based encryption solution.
In conclusion, the future enhancements of the Artificial Intelligence-based Security Solution for Data Encryption using AES Algorithm focus on making the system more secure, resilient, and user-friendly. By integrating advanced technologies like machine learning, blockchain, and multi-factor authentication, the system can provide a comprehensive and robust security solution for protecting sensitive data.
